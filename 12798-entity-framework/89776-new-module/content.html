<h1>Entity Framework Core</h1>
<p>EF Core is the newest incarnation of the Entity Framework, which was first created in 2008. Entity Framework Core was designed to be more powerful and flexible than Entity Framework&nbsp;and will support a wider variety of databases. As with all of the&nbsp;<code>core</code>&nbsp;technologies that Microsoft has created, EF Core is more modular than its previous versions. This means we can pull in just the pieces we need and avoid extra code-bloat.</p>
<h3>Important!&nbsp;</h3>
<p>EF Core, in tandem with what you've just learned in LINQ, is what we will be using for the remainder of the course to handle the database side of our projects. All the work you may have done up till now with setting up basic or psuedo-databases was an intro to get you prepared for this final section. As a result, please do not get too hung up on Dapper or any of the optional material you may have gone through previously. These optional database connections are handy to know, which is why they have been included, but they are separate from what we will be doing for the rest of the course.&nbsp;</p>
