<h2>Making Our Project and Adding Packages</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to get our project started is...a project! By this point, you should feel familiar with using <code>dotnet new mvc --no-https -o ProjectName</code> to create a project. Remember it's still important to use the <code>--no-https</code> flag to prevent any conflicts with adding security features! </p>
<p>Once you have a project created, the next step is to add a couple of packages for Entity Framework Core. Unlike the <code>dotnet ef-tools</code> command we ran before, these commands must be run <em>every time you start a new project</em> and inside the project in question. This is because the packages we want to use are not in our project by default and we want them in any project where we plan to connect to a database.</p>
<p>Head into your project and run these two commands from the terminal:</p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp">dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">-</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">-</span>version <span class="constant numeric from-rainbow">6.0</span>.<span class="constant numeric from-rainbow">1</span>
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">-</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">-</span>version <span class="constant numeric from-rainbow">6.0</span>.<span class="constant numeric from-rainbow">3</span></pre>
<p>You can verify that the installations worked by looking at your <code>ProjectName.csproj</code> file. You will see the packages listed there. This file is where we keep track of all the different packages and needs of our project.</p>
<h2>Making Our Models</h2>
<p>The next step is to create our models, the blueprints on which everything relating to our database and LINQ commands will run. This part will vary depending on how many models you need. If your project calls for one model, make one. If it calls for seven, you'll be making seven models during this part. This process will look nearly identical to what you have been doing so far working with models, but we will want to keep a few key things in mind:</p>
<ul><li>The name you give your model should be a singular name (i.e. User instead of Users). We will pluralize it for our database later.</li><li>The names you give to your properties will be the names of your columns in the database.</li><li>All names should follow PascalCasing standards (CapitalFirstLetter)</li><li>We will be using an auto-incremented integer ID for each model which we need to specify (see the example below).</li><li>Since this is going into a database, best practices state we should add CreatedAt and UpdatedAt properties to all models.</li></ul>
<p>For this example, we will design a database for cataloging Monsters. At this time, you should be thinking about what information you need to store in your models so that you can build out your model.</p>

<h3>[Key]?</h3>
<p>This is how we will indicate to our database that this is the name of our key in the database (the unique number that will allow us to easily find this one particular entry in our table). </p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> It is highly recommended to name your ID with the naming convention: ModelNameId! Failure to do so may cause confusion when the table is migrated into MySQL. Sometimes students experience that a separate column that follows this standard will automatically populate to "fix" the issue. This will cause several problems going forward! </p>
<h3>public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; } = DateTime.Now;</h3>
<p>Remember that not all values need to be filled in by our users! By doing this we can auto-populate every instance with a DateTime that will fill in the exact date and time the instance was created. Later, when we get to updating our models, we'll need to do a similar step again for UpdatedAt.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>At this time you can feel free to add your DataAnnotations for validations! They were left out here for brevity but will have no impact on this process.</p>
<h2>The Context Class</h2>
<p>Once you have all your models created, there is one more model we need to make in our Models folder. This is our <strong>context file</strong>. The context class is what forms the relationship between our models and the database. Think of it as an object that sits between our app and the database that translates our queries for us. Context classes, by convention, always have names that end in "Context". You can name the file anything (though something informative is your best option), just remember to add "Context" to the end!</p>
<p>The information inside our context file will be mostly the same every time, with adjustments made to accommodate your models.</p>
<h3>Models/MyContext.cs</h3>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp"><span class="comment from-rainbow">#pragma warning disable CS8618</span>
<span class="comment from-rainbow">// We can disable our warnings safely because we know the framework will assign non-null values </span>
<span class="comment from-rainbow">// when it constructs this class for us.</span>
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace YourProjectName.Models;
<span class="comment from-rainbow">// the MyContext class represents a session with our MySQL database, allowing us to query for or save data</span>
<span class="comment from-rainbow">// DbContext is a class that comes from EntityFramework, we want to inherit its features</span>
<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">class</span> MyContext : DbContext 
{   
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// This line will always be here. It is what constructs our context upon initialization  </span>
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="function call from-rainbow">MyContext</span>(DbContextOptions options) : <span class="function call from-rainbow">base</span>(options) { }    
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// We need to create a new DbSet&lt;Model&gt; for every model in our project that is making a table</span>
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// The name of our table in our database will be based on the name we provide here</span>
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// This is where we provide a plural version of our model to fit table naming standards    </span>
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DbSet<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&lt;</span>Monster<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> Monsters { get; set; } 
}</pre>
<p>Take a moment to go through everything happening in this file. It is very important that this is set up correctly so that everything we need is put into our database. If you forget to add a DbSet for a model, it will not appear in your database when you migrate.</p>
<p>As noted above, this is the time to give your tables their plural names. Every DbSet we create here will represent a table in our database. When the time comes to move these tables into MySQL, it will read these lines and create a table based on what it finds in the Monster class. </p>
<p>By default, MySQL will store our table names as lowercase but will be able to handle case insensitivity. It is still in our best interest to follow C# conventions here and make our variables uppercase. We will be needing these table names when the time comes to pull data from our database, so don't forget what you called them!</p>
<p>With that done, we are ready to move to the next section: setting up and securing our connection to our database.  </p>
