<p>One thing we have been demonstrating throughout these modules but not overtly addressing is the use of <strong>RESTful routing</strong> in our code. </p>
<p>REST stands for <strong>Re</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer. It is a set of standards used to create efficient, reusable routes for CRUD operations. Using this standard makes it easier for other developers to understand and navigate an application and results in clean, consistent URL paths for users.<br></p>
<p>As you have proceeded through this section, we have been demonstrating RESTful routing conventions, and it is in your best interest to know how to use them too. </p>
<p>In general, these are the route naming conventions we expect you to use through this course with regard to any pages dealing with our models (with modifications to route name as needed for uniqueness):</p>

<p>Screenshot this or refer to it as needed until the standard becomes familiar to you. We will be expecting you to follow this standard!<br></p>
<p>A small admission: There is actually a <em>more </em>correct version of RESTful routing standards that we are unable to use here due to constraints with our HTML forms being unable to handle patch (for updating) and delete requests. As you learn more about RESTful routing outside this course you may see deviations from what you see here. However, the fact remains that maintaining a consistent standard in naming conventions in your applications will always be considered best practices for programmers!<br></p>
