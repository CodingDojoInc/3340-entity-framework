<p>Creating models for your applications isn't just about considering the content within a model. We also have to be concerned with a model's relationship with other models! For example, having a user who is able to make posts on a website. A User table has to be able to connect to a Posts table to tell who wrote what post.<br></p>
<p>A relationship between two tables in which one instance from a table is capable of being attached to multiple instances of another table (i.e. our single User is capable of authoring many Posts, but that Post can only have been made by a single User) is called a <strong>One-to-Many Relationship</strong>.</p>
<p>MySQL is not capable of holding complex data like objects in its columns. To establish relationships between tables, we use the IDs of these objects to represent the relationship. For example, rather than storing the User object who made a post in our Post table, we would instead have a column to store the UserId, which we can then use (since IDs are unique) to identify which user made the post. </p>
<p>This will result in two tables that look like this:</p>
<p><strong>User.cs</strong></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp"><span class="comment from-rainbow">#pragma warning disable CS8618</span>
namespace YourProjectName.Models;

<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">class</span> User

    [Key]

    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> DateTime.Now;
}</pre>
<p><strong>Post.cs</strong></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp"><span class="comment from-rainbow">#pragma warning disable CS8618</span>
namespace YourProjectName.Models;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">class</span> Post
{    
    [Key]    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">int</span> PostId { get; set; }
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">string</span> Content { get; set; }
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> DateTime.Now;
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> DateTime.Now;
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// This is the ID we will use to know which User made the post</span>
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// This name should match the name of the key from the User table (UserId)</span>
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">int</span> UserId { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p>This is a good start, but now we get to talk about Entity Framework's role in relationships. Entity Framework Core is here to provide support because it <em>can</em> keep track of complex data. It will allow us to create something called a <strong>Navigation Property</strong> to reference the object (or List of objects) that connects our tables. </p>
<p>The Navigation Property will <em>not</em> map to our database by default, since it is complex data and meant only for EF Core. We will create Navigation Properties that connect our models to make it easy to access the adjoining table from either side.</p>
<p><strong>User.cs</strong></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp"><span class="comment from-rainbow">#pragma warning disable CS8618</span>
namespace YourProjectName.Models;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">class</span> User
{    
    [Key]    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">int</span> UserId { get; set; }       
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">string</span> Name { get; set; }

    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> DateTime.Now;
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// Our navigation property to track the many Posts our user has made</span>
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// Be sure to include the part about instantiating a new List!</span>
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> List<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&lt;</span>Post<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> AllPosts { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">new</span> List<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&lt;</span>Post<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span>();
}</pre>
<p><strong>Post.cs</strong></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp"><span class="comment from-rainbow">#pragma warning disable CS8618</span>
namespace YourProjectName.Models;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">class</span> Post
{    
    [Key]    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">int</span> PostId { get; set; }
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">string</span> Content { get; set; }
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> DateTime.Now;
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; } <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> DateTime.Now;
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">int</span> UserId { get; set; }
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// Our navigation property to track which User made this Post</span>
    <span class="comment from-rainbow">// It is VERY important to include the ? on the datatype or this won't work!</span>
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> User? Creator { get; set; }
}</pre>
<p>Now if we run migrations, we will see the Post table has a column for UserId, but neither has a reference to the navigation property. That does not mean it does not exist though! Once we have a few connections in our database made we can start using these navigation properties to their fullest.</p>
<h2>Adding A Post</h2>
<p>Once an item becomes the many side of a one-to-many relationship (one User making many posts) it is now entirely dependent on the existence of the one side to exist. After all, we can't make a post if there are no users around to author them. </p>
<p>This means we must first create some users who can make posts. Your login and registration assignment from before could be a good starting point, or you can create a project that creates some basic users who do not need to go through a login process. Either scenario will work.<br></p>
<p>Once you have some users available, our users can now start making posts. Depending on how you chose to test this the method for accessing the UserId may vary, but the important thing here is that upon creation of a Post, we must ensure that the UserId column is being filled in with the appropriate UserId. This may be done within a form, with session, or by some other means. </p>
<p>We will leave figuring out how exactly to pass the UserId into your Post to you! The important thing is that when a post is made that the UserId column is filled in just like any other attribute in our Post model.</p>
<p>Once you have a few posts that are linked to some users, we can start talking about how to pull this data using more of EF Core's built-in features.</p>
