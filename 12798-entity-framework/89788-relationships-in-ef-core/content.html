<p>Creating models for your applications isn't just about considering the content within a model. We also have to be concerned with a models relationship to other models! Of course, Entity Framework Core supports these relationships.</p>
<p>We can't create fields in MySQL that contain complex data (like another object), so we use the IDs of these objects to represent the relationship. In addition to the field for the ID we will&nbsp;<strong>also</strong> have a&nbsp;field for the full object for its own reference. However, this field will not be visible if we were to view the model in MySQL (because, as mentioned, MySQL does not support fields that contain entire objects). This is the one exception to our rule that our models have exactly the same fields as our database tables. Entity Framework Core is able to detect that the ID and object fields represent the same relationship -- based on their names -- but inside our table columns, we would only be able to see the IDs of our objects.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following schema. We have&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>user who is able to post&nbsp;<em>many</em> messages. But&nbsp;<em>one</em> message can only have been posted by&nbsp;<em>one</em> user. Therefore, we have a one to many relationship:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside of the Message model, we included <code>public int UserId</code> to let the database know which user is the creator of the message. When we create a message, this information will be passed along in the form submit just as the rest of the data would.</p>
<h2>Navigation Properties</h2>
<p>With Entity Framework, you can add a <em>reference</em> to the related model object known as a <strong>navigation property</strong>. For a <strong>Message</strong>, that would be the <strong>User </strong>that is associated with the&nbsp;<strong>Message</strong>, which we would identify&nbsp;by looking at the stored&nbsp;<strong>UserId </strong>(foreign key) that matches an existing&nbsp;<strong>User </strong>model's <strong>UserId </strong>(primary key). Inversely, you can have a navigation property on <strong>User</strong> that maps a <em>collection</em> of related <strong>Message</strong> objects. After all, a user can create many messages, so we would need to keep track of a List of messages created by the User. This list must be instantiated as an empty list and cannot be assigned the null forgiving property.&nbsp;<br></p>

</pre>
<p>We know that the <strong>messages</strong> SQL table doesn't have a <strong>Creator </strong>column, and that there is no <strong>User</strong> type for a column in SQL. This is all Entity Framework here. Because your <strong>Message&nbsp;</strong>model has a <strong>UserId</strong>, and your <strong>User</strong> model has a <strong>UserId</strong> as its primary key, Entity Framework knows to join data from a&nbsp;<strong>users&nbsp;</strong>table and map it to a <strong>User</strong> type member in <strong>Message</strong>. No extra input required!&nbsp; Once&nbsp;<strong>Message&nbsp;</strong>has a&nbsp;<strong>UserId</strong> it can reference, it creates the relationship to the&nbsp;<strong>User</strong> object for you! The same works for the User's list of Messages. Once a message is created, the User automatically has the relationship to message added to its list of created messages. You may name navigation properties whatever you like. Here, since a <strong>User </strong>creates <strong>Messages</strong>, it makes sense to name this property&nbsp;<strong>Creator</strong>.</p>
<h2>.Include()</h2>
<p>To understand exactly what's happening with the relationship between Users and Messages, let's try to do a query to show all the messages with the names of their creators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we just try to do a query for all messages, our controller would look something like this:</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> IActionResult <span class="function call from-rainbow">Index</span>()
{
    List<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&lt;</span>Message<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> messagesWithUser <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> dbContext.Messages.<span class="function call from-rainbow">ToList</span>();
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">return</span> <span class="function call from-rainbow">View</span>(messagesWithUser);
}
</pre>
<p>And our Index.cshtml might look something like this:
    </p>
<pre data-language="html" class="rainbow">@model List<span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">Message</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>
@foreach(var message in Model)
{
    <span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">p</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>@message.Creator.Name says: @message.Content<span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag special from-rainbow">/</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">p</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>
}
</pre>
<p>But if you tried to run your code right now, you would get this error!&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/Error.png"></figure>
<p>This is because by default, your DbSets will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> populate your model's navigation properties with related objects such as the User creator. Remember we mentioned that matching the UserId will&nbsp;<em>create</em> the relationship, so it knows which User to reference, but this does not mean the information is there. Think of it as a bookmark that keeps track of&nbsp;<em>where</em> the information is, but not&nbsp;<em>what</em> it is.<br></p>
<p>So how do we access that info? We need to&nbsp;<strong>include</strong> them. If we still wish to query for all messages, and display the <strong>Name</strong> of the message <strong>Creator</strong>, you will need to add an additional method call to your query expression: <strong>.Include()</strong>, where you provide a lambda expression that selects the navigation property you want to populate with related objects.</p>
<h3>In your Controller:</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> IActionResult <span class="function call from-rainbow">Index</span>()
{
    List<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&lt;</span>Message<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> messagesWithUser <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> dbContext.Messages
        <span class="comment from-rainbow">// populates each Message with its related User object (Creator)</span>
        .<span class="function call from-rainbow">Include</span>(message <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> message.Creator)
        .<span class="function call from-rainbow">ToList</span>();
    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">return</span> <span class="function call from-rainbow">View</span>(messagesWithUser);
}
</pre>
<p>Now when we run the code and go to our localhost, we see the data! Hopefully now you see the importance and power behind Entity Framework Core and .Include.</p>
<h2>Querying Related Data</h2>
<p>The use of a .Include() in your query expressions is the first step in making queries across tables/models, in that it will produce the related objects in your model's navigation properties.  This step will then allow you to query further into your model's relationships.  For example, if you wanted to know the number of CreatedMessages a User has produced, or the User with the longest Message, etc - you will need to follow a .Include() with the requisite LINQ expressions that target your model's relationships.  Let's see a few examples:</p>
<h3>In your Controller:</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp" class="rainbow active_pre">[<span class="function call from-rainbow">HttpGet</span>(<span class="string from-rainbow">"{userId}"</span>)]

<h2>But wait, I managed to get my information to display <em>without </em>using a .Include!!</h2>
<p>This might happen to you if you spend enough time playing around with queries. And the reason is a little sneaky on C#'s part. Say we're back to querying for all our messages and we want to display the name of the Creator, but somehow you've noticed that you rendered the information anyway without using a .Include. Look around in your route! What other queries are happening on that same page? If you have another query that is gathering all the&nbsp;<em>Users</em>, then you have your answer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>EF Core is a smart framework. It's capable of making certain leaps of logic such as relating objects for us with just an ID provided. And it's doing something similar here. The information your query is after (the names of the creators) is technically already there. It's just wrapped up in another query meant for a different result on the same page. But our program is smart enough to realize "Hey, I already grabbed this information earlier for this other query, so since I have it, I'll just tag it on to this query you're doing!"</p>
<p>You might notice the same result if your messages are all made by the same user, and you, the logged in user, are able to see the page just fine, but you get errors when you try to log in as anyone else! If you've done any separate queries for the logged in user (say, if you wanted to display the user's name in the navigation bar at the top) then you've essentially done the same thing, but it only works for things related to the logged in user. It is good to be aware of this logic loophole in case you're getting strange moments where some things are rendering for some users and not for others!</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer!!&nbsp;</strong>Just because we are now aware of the extra connections EF will make for us does&nbsp;<em>not</em> mean we should rely on it! If you are doing a query that requires an include you&nbsp;<em>must</em> use it! It is always better to be explicit rather than implicit with your code!<br></p>
