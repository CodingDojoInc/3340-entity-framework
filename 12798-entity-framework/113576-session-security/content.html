<p>After successfully registering or logging in, a user is directed to the first internal page. This is usually a dashboard page of some sort with information specific to the user. This and many other internal pages should not be accessible to anyone who has not logged in. But after we pass through login and registration how do we verify that the person viewing our page is, in fact, logged in?<br></p>
<p>If the title of this page was any sort of hint, you may have thought "I can track my logged-in user with session" and you would be right! A session is a great way for us to keep track of who exactly is logged into our website on a given machine (since the session is saved to your cookies, which are bound to your browser). </p>
<p>Ideally, we will want to store our user's UserId in session upon successful registration or login. Refer back to our content on session if you need a refresher on how to set up and use it.</p>
<p>Once you are ready, head back over to your login and registration code and ask yourself this: at what point should I be saving a UserId into session?</p>
<p>The answer: the moment before you redirect the user to the first internal page. Your code might look something like this:</p>
<p><strong>HomeController.cs</strong></p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">// Surrounding registration code
HttpContext.Session.SetInt32("UserId", newUser.UserId);
return RedirectToAction("SomeAction");
// Surrounding registration code</pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> After saving a new object to the database, it will have an ID ready to go, so you will be able to access an ID even from the user object that was just created in registration as shown above.</p>
<p>Great! You have session up and running in your project. Now what? How will it tell you whether or not someone is logged into your website?</p>
<p>Pop quiz: if you search for a session by a specific key and that key does not exist, what do you get back?</p>
<p>The answer: </p>
<p>Null.</p>
<p>This means we have two scenarios: either the session is there and we get a number back, or it's not and we get back null. This will be how we determine if a user has logged in. On every page where we intend to see information that only a logged-in user should see, we need to run a check to make sure that person is logged in by checking to see if a session for UserId exists.</p>
<p>There are a few ways we can do this, but let's go over a way that is efficient and makes use of more of ASP.NET Core's library of features. There is something called <strong>ActionFilterAttribute</strong> that lives in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-6.0" target="_blank">Filters</a> library of AspNetCore.Mvc. </p>
<p>When we are finished making it, it will look very similar to how a custom validation looks. Only instead of applying to a single property in a model, we can apply it to a whole route in our Controller, giving us the power to go through the filter before landing on that route.</p>
<p>To start, we need to bring in a package to the top of our controller:</p>
<p><strong>HomeController.cs</strong></p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters;</pre>
<p>This is the library where all the tools we need live.</p>
<p>Next, we can write our code. You can add this to the very bottom of your Controller file:</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">// Name this anything you want with the word "Attribute" at the end
public class SessionCheckAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Find the session, but remember it may be null so we need int?
        int? userId = context.HttpContext.Session.GetInt32("UserId");
        // Check to see if we got back null
        if(userId == null)
        {
            // Redirect to the Index page if there was nothing in session
            // "Home" here is referring to "HomeController", you can use any controller that is appropriate here
            context.Result = new RedirectToActionResult("Index", "Home", null);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, on any route where we want to verify that our user is logged in, we can include the following code:</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">// The name we gave our class minus "Attribute"
[SessionCheck]
[HttpGet("someRoute")]
// The rest of the code</pre>
<p>Now if you try to navigate to the "someRoute" route, you will instead be routed to Index if you are not logged in. Security achieved!</p>
<p>Going forward, there is more we can do to add security to our website, but this is a good start and you should get in the habit of verifying you have a logged-in user on any pages that should be restricted to logged-in users only.</p>
