            <h1>Week 3: Monday</h1><h2>Algorithms for the Week:</h2>
<p>These are the algorithms you should focus on for the week, depending on which stack your C# cohort is occurring.&nbsp; The overall ability of each particular cohort may fluctuate, but try and get through as many as you/they are able.
</p>
<h4>Stack 2: Strings II</h4><ul><li>String To Word Array</li><li>Reverse Word Order</li><li>Longest Word</li><li>Unique Words</li><li>Unique Letters</li><li>Longest Palindrome</li></ul>
<h4>Stack 3: Hashes</h4><ul><li>Constructor Function V1 (no collision mitigations)</li><li>Add V1</li><li>Get V1</li><li>Remove V1</li><li>Constructor Function (collision mitigation with separate chaining - SLL)</li><li>Add V2</li><li>Get V2</li><li>Remove V2</li></ul><h2>Lecture: Many to Manys</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Compare to One to Many scenario, how will this be different?</li>
	<li>Getting data across multiple models: .ThenInclude()</li>
	<li>Scenario: spotting a many to many from wireframe.  Share a wireframe with students, ask them to come up with schema design, approach.</li>
