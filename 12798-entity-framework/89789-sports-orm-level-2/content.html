<h1>Sports ORM (Level 2)</h1>
<p>Now that you understand something about querying for data using their relationships, it's time to revisit the Sports ORM assignment from LINQ and tackle level 2. There you will have a few queries to make, all of which require that you use a .Include to get to the answer. Try some of them out and get familiar with the process of querying from one table into another using the one to many relationships that exist between them. (Check out the models in the Sports ORM file to see what naming conventions have been used for these relationships.)&nbsp;</p><p>A quick hint for some of the questions: think about how you can filter for data both with and without using the built in queries. What sorts of filters could you apply using logic on your cshtml side?</p><p>Please refer back to the original Sports ORM assignment in the LINQ section if you need to download the file again.</p>
