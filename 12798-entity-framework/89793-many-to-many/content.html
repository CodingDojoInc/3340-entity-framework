<p>Whenever we have two tables that can have multiple associations between each other for each entry (i.e. one store can sell many products and that one product could be sold at many stores) we need to create a many-to-many relationship. </p>
<p>Setting up a many-to-many requires a bit more work than a one-to-many, and it is very important to know what type of relationship you are intending to set up from the beginning.<br></p>
<p>Any time we want to create a many-to-many, it is going to require that we create a <em>third table</em>. This table is our joining table, where all the various associations between the original two tables live. If you have ever created a many-to-many relationship directly in MySQL before, you have likely seen this table auto-populate. In our case, we need to manually create it. </p>
<p>Check out the example below to see how a many-to-many relationship would be created. In this case, we have created a many-to-many between Magazines and People. We have decided this is a many-to-many because <strong>one</strong> person is able to have subscriptions to <strong>many</strong> magazines, and <strong>one</strong> magazine can have <strong>many</strong> people who subscribe to it. </p>

<p>The major differences to note here is the existence of the third table and how our primary tables each contain a List of that third table. This is how our relationship is established. Any time we want to access information about what magazines a person is subscribed to or how many people are subscribed to a certain magazine, it is going to require us to first go through the Subscription table to access further information on the Person or Magazine.</p>
<p>So how would we do this? With two Includes? One to go from Person to Subscription and the next to go from Subscription to Magazine? Almost. There is actually another built-in method specifically for handling this. It is called ThenInclude.</p>
<h2>.ThenInclude()</h2>
<p>Once we start working with many-to-manys, we have three tables to work with instead of two. Accessing data across these tables requires us to hop from one table to the other to the other. To access the closest adjoining table (i.e. going from Person to Subscription) we would still use Include to get inside the Subscription table. But then to access information about the magazines in relation to our Person, we must make another jump into the Magazine table from Subscription using ThenInclude.</p>
<p>The code will end up looking like this:</p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp">Person personWithMags <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> _context.People    	
                                .<span class="function call from-rainbow">Include</span>(subs <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> subs.Subscriptions)            
                                .<span class="function call from-rainbow">ThenInclude</span>(sub <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> sub.Magazine)        
                                .<span class="function call from-rainbow">FirstOrDefault</span>(person <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> person.PersonId <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> personId);</pre>
<p>See what we did here? First, we used Include to get into the Subscription table. Then, from within our Subscription table, we ThenInclude-d our Magazines before narrowing the query down to one person. With this, we now have information on one person and all the magazines they are subscribed to.</p>

<p>If we wanted to render this information, it would look something like this:<br></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="html">@model Person
<span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">h1</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>Subscriptions for @Model.Name<span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag special from-rainbow">/</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">h1</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>
@foreach(Subscription sub in Model.Subscriptions)
{    
    <span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">p</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>@sub.Magazine.Title<span class="support tag from-rainbow"><span class="support tag from-rainbow">&lt;</span><span class="support tag special from-rainbow">/</span><span class="support tag-name from-rainbow">p</span></span><span class="support tag close from-rainbow">&gt;</span>
}</pre>
<p>Remember that our Person contains a List of Subscriptions, which we are now looping through. For each Subscription we encounter, there is information on a single Magazine, which we access through our Subscription to get the Title.</p>
<p>Working with ThenInclude can feel confusing the first time around. Play around with the queries until you start to understand how and where the data is coming from. We will be using these queries a lot very soon!</p>
