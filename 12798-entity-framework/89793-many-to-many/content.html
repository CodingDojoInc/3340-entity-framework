<p>Many-to-many relationships in EF Core are set up in the same way as we've handled them with SQL in the past. We create a joining table that contains a pair of IDs to establish the connections between the two tables we want to join. Using this joining table, we can now set up a Navigation Property inside of the two models based on the joining table. You can see below how this works:</p>

<p>What exactly is a many to many relationship? You should have been exposed to the idea of many to many relationships in earlier courses, but just in case here is a refresher: a many to many relationship denotes that two objects (from our model classes) share relationships with one another where each contains a list of the other. In the above example we use people and magazines. Think of how the relationship works in real life. In real life,&nbsp;<strong>one</strong> person can subscribe to&nbsp;<strong>many</strong> different magazines. And&nbsp;<strong>one</strong> magazine can have&nbsp;<strong>many</strong> people who are subscribed to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to keep track of who is subscribed to what magazine and vice versa, we must create a third table called&nbsp;<em>Subscriptions</em>. You can call this table anything that would make sense in describing the relationship. When you were making your own relationships directly in MySQL, you should have noticed that this table auto-populates wherever you've created a many to many relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscription table contains two important pieces of information: the ID of the person and the ID of the magazine that are related. As we covered in one to many relationships, once the ID of an object is known EF does a handy job of finding the object for us, which we keep track of in our model.</p>
<p>From there, we need to keep track of what magazines we are subscribed to in our people table and vice versa. But we wouldn't put a list of magazines inside our person model. Instead we want a list of&nbsp;<em>Subscriptions</em>. This is handier than simply keeping a list of Magazines inside our model because we can do better queries with this information neatly wrapped up in a separate model. Think of what you would need to do to find all the people subscribed to a certain magazine without the subscription class. You would need to query for&nbsp;<em>all</em> the people, and then you would need to loop through&nbsp;<em>all</em> the magazines they're subscribed to in order to see if they are subscribed to that certain magazine. Whereas with the subscription model we can now just say "give me all the users subscribed to this magazine." But if you recall, we cannot actually&nbsp;<em>see</em> this information without a .Include().&nbsp;</p>
<p>However just like how we don't have immediate access to a Creator object in messages without an include, simply querying for the subscription model won't get us access to the objects stored inside. While it is possible to stack .Include's on top of each other for certain queries, if we want to access the subscriptions&nbsp;<em>then</em> the person or magazine object inside of it, we need to use another query: .ThenInclude().</p>
<h2>.ThenInclude()</h2>
<p>Much like when querying for data with a One to Many relationship, you will need to tell Entity Framework to <strong>include </strong>data from your model's navigation properties. The difference here is that if you want to include the navigation property of a navigation property (ie. a <strong>Person</strong> with <strong>Subscriptions</strong> that contain a <strong>Magazine</strong>), you<strong> </strong>must follow with a <strong>ThenInclude</strong><strong>() </strong>method, which takes a lambda expression selecting the navigation property you wish to select from the one before.<br></p>
<p>Say we wanted to get a list of all the magazines that a person is subscribed to. We would first query into our Person DbSet, and then we want to include from our person the List of Subscriptions:</p>
<p><strong>.</strong><strong>Include(person =&gt; person.Subscriptions)</strong> <br></p>
<p>After which, we need to access the magazine objects that are inside our subscriptions, so we need to then include:</p>
<p><strong>.ThenInclude(subscription =&gt; subscription.Magazine)</strong><br></p>
<p>Finally, we query for a FirstOrDefault person at a provided personId, and now we have access to all the magazine data that the person is subscribed to!</p>
<h3>In your Controller:</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp" class="rainbow active_pre">[<span class="function call from-rainbow">HttpGet</span>(<span class="string from-rainbow">"{personId}"</span>)]
<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> IActionResult <span class="function call from-rainbow">Show</span>(<span class="keyword from-rainbow">int</span> personId)
{
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">var</span> personWithSubsAndMags <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> dbContext.Persons
    	.<span class="function call from-rainbow">Include</span>(person <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> person.Subscriptions)
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<span class="function call from-rainbow">ThenInclude</span>(sub <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> sub.Magazine)
        .<span class="function call from-rainbow">FirstOrDefault</span>(person <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> person.PersonId <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> personId);
    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">return</span> <span class="function call from-rainbow">View</span>(personWithSubsAndMags);
}
</pre>
<p>Now that we have that information, we can display it!</p>
