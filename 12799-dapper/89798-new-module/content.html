<h1>Dapper ORM</h1>
<p>Dapper is a Micro-ORM that was built by StackExchange (the parent company of StackOverflow) for one main purpose: to allow for mapping database responses to models while not sacrificing any speed provided by raw SQL.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of data and number of relations each rendered page of StackOverflow has, the engineers there knew that they couldn't be spending a lot of time "over the wire" making multiple requests and waiting for responses to and from ASP.NET and a database server. Rather, they needed a system where they could just build one rockstar SQL query string that would get all the information they needed in one hit. As such, they did not want to take the typical approach of many ORMs, which sacrifices this possibility in exchange for developers' ease of use when dealing with simple requests. In other words, the Dapper framework they created still requires the developer to write the SQL query manually to ensure that only a single request is being made to the database to get the desired results.</p>
<p>By doing this, the Dapper framework minimizes hits to the database resulting in the aforementioned speed. What Dapper does on the request side is ease the call to the database for the user by obscuring some of the boilerplate that goes along with making this request. Dapper also would not be an ORM if it did not give us the ability to <strong>map</strong> models to our data in some way. Once we get a response string back from the database, Dapper can map the different keys and values for the model objects you provided to the various string fields of the response.</p>
<p>Dapper was built by Sam Saffron and is actively used on StackExchange sites. <a href="https://samsaffron.com/archive/2011/03/30/How+I+learned+to+stop+worrying+and+write+my+own+ORM" target="_blank">You can read more from Sam Saffron himself</a>. It also provides features like Object Binding and direct access to the IDBConnection class too.</p>
<p>This process is extremely similar to the model mapping we saw when we sent information from the form to the controller as a model rather than separate inputs. Once we have instances of our model classes, the rest is up to us!</p>
