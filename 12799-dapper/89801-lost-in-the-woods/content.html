<p>For this assignment, we will be practicing our newly learned knowledge of Dapper by building an app that showcases various hiking trails. This app will have a list of hiking trails that each have a few properties: Trail Name, Description, Trail Length, Elevation Gain, Longitude and Latitude. All trails are listed on a main page. Each trail name is a link to view the individual trail's information page. The wireframe for the assignment is provided below:</p><p>(Note: the Latitude and Longitude in the wireframe are backwards: longitude ranges between -180 and 180; latitude between -90 and 90)</p>
