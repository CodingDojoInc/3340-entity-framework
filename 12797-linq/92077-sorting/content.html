<p>Now is the time to start writing some LINQ queries! In the absence of a database, we will create a dataset using a model and an array of that model. LINQ is not limited to working with data from databases. It can be performed on any set of data!<br></p>
<p>To get started, create a <code>dotnet new console</code> project called "LINQPractice". We do not need an entire MVC project to be able to practice some LINQ queries. Then we'll create a simple class called Product that will have a few properties:</p>
<h3>Product.cs</h3>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp"><span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">class</span> Product
{    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">string</span> Name {get;set;}    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">string</span> Category {get;set;}    
    <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> <span class="keyword from-rainbow">double</span> Price {get;set;}
}</pre>
<p>Now that we have a model, we'll create an array of Products. We can do this in Program.cs since we will be performing all of our queries from there.</p>
<h3>Program.cs</h3>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="c_sharp">Product[] myProducts <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> new Product[]
{     
    new Product { Name <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Jeans", Category <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Clothing", Price <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> 24.7 },     
    new Product { Name <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Socks", Category <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Clothing", Price <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> 8.12 },     
    new Product { Name <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Scooter", Category <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Vehicle", Price <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> 99.99 },     
    new Product { Name <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Skateboard", Category <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Vehicle", Price <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> 24.99 },     
    new Product { Name <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Skirt", Category <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> "Clothing", Price <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> 17.5 }
};</pre>
<p>With this as our "database", we can start doing some queries!</p>
<p>We'll start by going over an example query. By now you have seen a few queries in action and should understand how the lambda expression is working within the query, but it's good to review again. The first thing we will do is take our product array and sort it based on price (think a user has just applied a "sort by price" filter in their search).</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp" class="rainbow">IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; sortProductsByPrice = myProducts.<span class="function call from-rainbow">OrderByDescending</span>(prod =&gt; prod.Price);</pre>
<p>So what is going on here? Let's break it down one piece at a time:</p>
<h3>IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;</h3>
<p>What is this IEnumerable type? This is simply the interface (remember interfaces?) for any data type that can be iterated through (i.e. Lists, arrays, and dictionaries). In an earlier example, we had a .ToList() tagged to the end of our query, which cast the IEnumerable into a List. Since Lists have the IEnumerable interface applied to them, this is a valid conversion. </p>
<p>By default, any query that returns a collection of data will return an IEnumerable of that type. It is easy to cast it to the collection type we want using .ToList or .ToArray though. We did not do it here so we can show a bare-bones example.</p>
<h3>sortProductsByPrice</h3>
<p>This is simply the variable name that we will use to reference the results of our query. We could call this anything we like, but this name makes sense since we are getting a list of our products sorted by price.</p>
<h3>myProducts</h3>
<p>This is what we called the original array (look up for a reminder). We are starting our query by saying "I am looking to perform an operation on the dataset called 'myProducts'", which will then fetch all the data we have in myProducts to perform the operation on.</p>
<h3>.OrderByDescending</h3>
<p>This one should be pretty straightforward. This is our LINQ query. We are saying here that we would like to take this dataset of myProducts and order them in descending (highest to lowest) order. The only thing we are missing is <em>what</em> we are using to order them by (the price, which will come up in a moment). If we wanted to do the opposite, we would use .OrderBy (this assumes ascending order). </p>
<h3>(prod =&gt; prod.Price)</h3>
<p>Here we have our lambda function in action! As we covered in the last section, we begin by instantiating a variable (prod in this case, but remember it could be anything). Then we apply our lambda arrow and specify what part of each object we are using (in this case, prod.Price). Remember that each product is a whole object that has a Price attribute. As long as we know what features are available to us in our models, we are able to use any of these features to help us with our queries. </p>
<p>Then we're done! We would get back an IEnumerable of type Product with all our products ordered in descending order by their price. Now we could render this data or do whatever else we need with it. </p>
<h3>Chaining Methods</h3>
<p>One neat thing to note is that all the features you use to make a query can be chained together by separating them with a period <code>.</code>. Say we wanted to grab our products by price, but we would also like to grab just the products that are in the "Clothing" category. We don't have to make two separate queries to get this to happen. We can do it all at once like so:</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp" class="rainbow">IEnumerable<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&lt;</span>Product<span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> orderedClothingProducts <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> myProducts.<span class="function call from-rainbow">Where</span>(c <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> c.Category <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span> <span class="string from-rainbow">"Clothing"</span>).<span class="function call from-rainbow">OrderByDescending</span>(prod <span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">=</span><span class="keyword operator from-rainbow">&gt;</span> prod.Price);</pre>
<p>See what we did there? We were able to tag the Where query before our order by descending query by separating the queries with a period. We could do this as many times as we'd like, though it is important to note that some queries need to be executed before others in order to run, and some queries will not play nicely with each other. For example, it doesn't make sense to order all our products by price if we just planned to pull one item from the dataset, right?</p>
<p>We could swap the Where and OrderByDescending queries and they will still work, though it could be argued it makes more sense to find the items we need before ordering them by price to prevent ourselves from unnecessarily ordering products we're not planning to use.</p>
<p>Your compiler will give you notifications if it doesn't agree with how you're doing a query. Sometimes it's not that you can't do the query, it's that the order matters and you need to shift the order of your queries around.</p>
<h2>More Queries</h2>
<p>Below is a list of some of the other queries that can be performed on a dataset. Take some time to test these out on the product array to get familiar with how they work. </p>

    <li>As mentioned above, try some of these queries out yourself on the dataset we have provided. Leave plenty of comments on what each query is doing and what kinds of results you can expect back from them. </li>
