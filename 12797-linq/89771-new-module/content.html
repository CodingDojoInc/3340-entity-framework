<p>Before we go any further into databases and ORMs, we will need to dig into a library of methods that are used to perform queries on sets of data. While these methods can be used on any collection (arrays, lists, etc. of <em>any</em> type), this library will be particularly valuable when we start using Entity Framework, the primary ORM we will use for this stack.</p>
<p>So let's go ahead and take a quick step back from building web applications and take a minute to learn <strong>LINQ</strong>!</p>
<p>LINQ (pronounced "link") allows you to work with any dataset with SQL-esque methods. It's a very valuable tool that exists in the .NET framework and makes sorting, ordering, and searching through datasets simple once you learn the syntax. Recall briefly how you would query into your MySQL database. You would need to remember syntax such as SELECT * FROM Userdb.users WHERE userid = '2', or run long join queries in order to access something found using a foreign key. Now with LINQ we can perform the same types of queries with shorter syntax and make Entity Framework handle much of the legwork for us!</p>
<p>There are two different notations that can be used with LINQ, <strong>Method Syntax </strong>and <strong>Query Syntax</strong>; to keep things focused we will use <strong>Method Syntax </strong>in this course.&nbsp; <br></p>
