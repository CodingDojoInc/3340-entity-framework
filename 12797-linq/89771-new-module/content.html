<p>Before we get into working with databases and ORMs, we first need to understand how to manipulate lists of data. This is an important first step because it can be done without needing to get into the complicated database connection process and without needing to know how to add data to a database just yet. We want to show you how to filter data before things get too complex so that you know how to work with the data that will soon be coming from our databases.<br></p>
<p>A long time ago, programmers decided that having to write raw SQL queries to talk to their database was too verbose and wasted precious time they could be spending building applications. In truth, a lot of handy programming tools came about because programmers decided "this is taking too long, why don't I write a library that will automate all of this?" </p>
<p>Intro <strong>LINQ</strong> (pronounced "link"), short for <strong>Language Integrated Query</strong>. In 2007, LINQ debuted as a major part of .NET Framework 3.5. Its purpose was to generate queries to retrieve data without needing to know how to actually write queries for the database that data was stored in. This was a game changer, as the queries were not only easy to read (no bulky raw query lines necessary), but it kept everything contained to the project you were working in without ever needing to open the database program you were using.</p>
<p>LINQ allows you to work with any dataset with SQL-esque methods. It makes sorting, ordering, and searching through datasets simple once you learn the syntax. And once we have it working alongside Entity Framework (coming soon), it becomes a breeze to work with databases!</p>
