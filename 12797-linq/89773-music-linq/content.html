<p>For instructors who still wish to use Music LINQ as an assignment, the two assignments relating to it have been left in tact.</p><p>With our new LINQ knowledge, we can now parse through large sets of data stored in any type of collection.&nbsp;For this assignment we will have a List of Artist objects and a List of Group objects to work through. By using various LINQ methods we can get a lot of interesting information from our two collections to solve&nbsp;various problems. Since the goal of this assignment is solely to practice LINQ, we have provided some starter code for this assignment. In the Program.cs file's Main function, we have already set up and populated the two collections that all your queries should be based on. The Artist class file and Group Class file are also provided as a reference to their properties.</p>
