Just as a remdiner, you can create a console application through your terminal by typing the command:</p><p>dotnet new console -o YourProjectName</p><p><br></p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DbSet&lt;league&gt; Leagues {<span class="keyword from-rainbow">get</span>;<span class="keyword from-rainbow">set</span>;}
   <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DbSet&lt;team&gt; Teams {<span class="keyword from-rainbow">get</span>;<span class="keyword from-rainbow">set</span>;}
   <span class="keyword from-rainbow">public</span> DbSet&lt;player&gt; Players {<span class="keyword from-rainbow">get</span>;<span class="keyword from-rainbow">set</span>;}</pre>
<p>These are your connections to the tables within your database (all that information you saw in the DataController), hooked up to the league, team, and player models you saw earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in our HomeController, let's look at our example query:</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">    ViewBag.BaseballLeagues <span class="operator from-rainbow">=</span> context.Leagues
                .Where(l <span class="operator from-rainbow">=&gt;</span> l.Sport.Contains(<span class="string from-rainbow">"Baseball"</span>));  </pre>
<p>ViewBag you should be familiar with, and you should have seen references to the queries .Where and .Contains and how to create these queries on the page before. But what about context and Leagues? Well, look up! "Leagues" matches the Leagues we see in Context.cs. And context is what we've called our connection to the database.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code reads like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <code>ViewBag.BaseballLeagues</code>, query into my database (<code>context</code>) and look into my table for <code>Leagues</code>. From my Leagues table, I want all the leagues <code>Where</code> the <code>Sport</code> (a property of the League model) <code>Contains</code> the word&nbsp;<code>"Baseball"</code>. Now in our ViewBag, we have a list of all the Leagues where the sport is baseball. On our cshtml side we can render this information in a table, and voila! Our information is rendered!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Don't worry if this seems like a lot of confusing information. We'll be breaking this down in detail in the next section. In general your queries will look like this:</p>
<pre>
ViewBag.&lt;Name of bag&gt; = context.&lt;Name of table&gt;.&lt;Your query goes here&gt;&nbsp;</pre>
<p>For the time being you only need to concern yourself with finishing&nbsp;<strong>Level 1<em>.&nbsp;</em></strong>The following levels require queries that we have not covered yet, and you will be completing these levels for later assignments. The point here is to get started practicing a variety of LINQ queries. Work until you feel comfortable performing basic queries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you are using a different version of dotnet, make sure to go into the <code>.csproj</code> file and change the version number then run <code>dotnet restore</code> to update the package installations</p>
