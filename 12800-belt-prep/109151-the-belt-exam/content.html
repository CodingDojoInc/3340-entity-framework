(This equates to a red belt on the rubric.)</li><li>To achieve a <strong>black belt</strong>, you must achieve a score between 9.5 and 10 within 5 hours and must successfully deploy your exam to an AWS EC2 instance within 24 hours. You must achieve both of these to qualify.</li></ul>
<p>You have <strong>3 chances </strong>to pass your exam before the final available exam day. Check your course schedule to see what the last day is to take the exam and consult your instructor for further details on retaking and cutoff times.</p>
